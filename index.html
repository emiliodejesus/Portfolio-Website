            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>I'm Emilio E. De Jesús Hernández and this is my portfolio webpage, an archive of all my endeavors and professional growth. This is a webpage I built from the ground up, an attempt at showcasing my web building skills but also serving as a place to share my favorite activities/hobbies and record the evolution of my efforts.</p>
            <p>Since a very young age I have been intrigued to learn from an array of topics concerning science and technology, music and other art forms and along the way I have picked on many hobbies and interests. From retro gaming console hardware fixes and enhancements, car repair, mods and restoration, coding projects, photography. I started off studying at the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez campus, and finished my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering on Jun 2024. I am actively seeking on new ways I can improve as an engineer and ways I can acquire new skills to make myself relevant in the industry.</p>
